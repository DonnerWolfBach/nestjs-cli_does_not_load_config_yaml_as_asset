# nestjs-cli_does_not_load_config_yaml_as_asset
This demonstrates a potentional bug in NestJS (Version 7.5.4). 

It follows the [documentation on how to use a config.yaml file for configuration via the NestJS ConfigModule and ConfigService](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration#custom-configuration-files) - the version I used and didn't work was viewed on 22.January 2021.
